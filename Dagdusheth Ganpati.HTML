			Shrimant Dagadusheth Halwai and his wife Laxmibai was a trader and sweet maker settled in Pune. His original halwai shop still exists under the name "Dagdusheth Halwai Sweets" near Datta Mandir in Pune. Eventually he became a successful sweet seller and a rich businessman. In the later 1800s, they lost their only son in a plague epidemic. They were approached by a compassionate sage who advised them to build a Ganesha temple in Pune.
